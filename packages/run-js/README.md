Test your JavaScript code snippets within the RemNote environment with ease.

## Usage

- All you need to do is just type keyboard shortcut(`⌥`(Alt)+`⇧`+`c`) or omnibar/slash command named `Run JS`
- It can turn current code block into js evaluation mode.
- It can generate a blank RunJS code block if the caret is within a blank line.
- It can revert all the evaluation mode if it is within a RunJS code block, but you can also regenerate the evaluation mode in a blank line.
- When you click the ▶️ button, you'll see the results in the console. That's it!

## Roadmap
- Typescript Support
- Rendering evaluation results directly without the need to open console tab
